// Variables

var x = 2
var p = "perimeter";
var thelength;
var thewidth;
var doubleit;
// changed the variables around to be able to do the formula for perimeter

// Array

var Myarray = ["length", "width", "and multiplying by 2"];


// prompts

thelength = prompt("enter the length");
thewidth = prompt("enter the width");
doubleit = prompt("now multiply that by two")

// outputs

console.log("the" + " " + p + " " + "of the rectangle" + " " + "is" + " " + thelength * thewidth *x + ".");
// a lot of trial and error done here to get a full clear sentence without run ons.
console.log("All the factors when finding out the perimeter are" + " " +  "the" + " " +  Myarray + ".");
